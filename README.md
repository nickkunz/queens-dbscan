Included in this repo is part of the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) methodology used in the project "Signal or Noise? Qualified Opportunity Zone Affect on Development Activity in Queens, New York from 2015 to 2018". The step not included here was the spatial join of intersecting census blocks to building permit and real estate sales point centroids. The methodology was conducted in R and was written without optimization or data frame lists in order to be explicit. Interpretability for those less familiar with coding was important.

All other data handling procedures and analyses, including the comparative methodology - Anselin Local Moran's I - was completed outside of the R environment (ArcGIS). The publicly available data has also been included in the link [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GC_N-HRVq1KBLgENtm4CiHNiPVkBnAcL?usp=sharing "queens-dbscan data") for the raw reproduction of the DBSCAN methodology. In addition, the final [report](https://github.com/nickkunz/queens-dbscan/reports/queens_report.pdf) and [poster](https://github.com/nickkunz/queens-dbscan/reports/queens_poster.png) has been included for distribution. Please observe the correct citations when using this information.

This analysis was conducted with Suprima Bhele and completed as a final project in partial fulfillment for the course Advanced Spatial Analysis at Columbia GSAPP in 2019.
